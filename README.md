# Thieving Stall Counter
This plugin will display how many stalls you have thieved in your session and what your associated pet chance is.

The stats show the following:

- How many stalls you have thieved since installing the plugin
- The % chance of having received at least one pet.

Different stalls have different odds of getting the pet, these are all taken into consideration when calculation the pet chance.

These stats can be turned off if you don't want to see some of them.
